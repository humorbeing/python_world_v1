# How is this code?
- Self right optimization steps. This is a good idea to keep the mechanism remembered.
- naming is readable.
- In the code, it did some math, still vague to me.
- It trained a energy-based model to reconstruct the input image. Then use this model to extract features of the image and trained a classifier? Interesting.
- keep align
