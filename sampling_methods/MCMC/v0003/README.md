# About This Code
- something is wrong with the tutorial.
- MCMC is used in sampling from distribution. And parameter estimation with Bayesian Estimation.
- But NOW, this post says estimating posterior distribution Pi(x)
- I don't understand. the code is neither about sampling nor about estimating a parameter in a distribution PDF.
