# About This Code
- Fix the sns plotting.
- Rejection Sampling sure is simple. But it has some drawback. We have to have pretty good heuristic on choosing the proposal distribution Q(x). It has to envelope the target distribution. Given a complicated target distribution, it’s hard to know the shape, and it’s hard to choose the proposal distribution.
